  # Esfahan to Tehran
  After visiting Reza and his family in Esfahan, I wanted to be in Tehran a couple of days early to make sure I caught my flight to India.

  ## Random hospitality in Kashan
  First stop was in Kashan. After a long ride in the desert, in the evening I started to set up my tent at a park.

  Just when I was done setting up the tent, a guy who was having a call nearby asked me what I was doing. He told me you can get in trouble for wild camping (not my experience :-)) and offered me to come to his house instead. Although I was looking forward to some alone time, he seemed cool so I gladly accepted his offer and started breaking down the tent again.

  At his home, I was immediately greeted Iranian style - a cup of tea and a lot of food. His mother had made a spinach-bean meal, which reminded me of the Dutch-style "stamppotje" spinach my mom would make at home. I had already finished dinner, but in a grandma-esque way they were really insistent on me eating a lot of it. Oh well, I was going to be cycling a lot the next day anyway!

  One thing that struck me about this family is how they spend the night - the whole family sleeps in the living room, even though they have more rooms in the house. Fortunately, they had mosquito nets!
