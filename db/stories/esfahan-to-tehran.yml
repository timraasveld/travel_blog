  # Esfahan to Tehran
  After visiting Reza and his family in Esfahan, I wanted to be in Tehran a couple of days early to make sure I caught my flight to India.

  ## Random hospitality in Kashan
  First stop was in Kashan. After a long ride in the desert, in the evening I started to set up my tent at a park.

  Just when I was done setting up the tent, a guy who was having a call nearby asked me what I was doing. He told me you can get in trouble for wild camping (not my experience :-)) and offered me to come to his house instead. Although I was looking forward to some alone time, he seemed cool so I gladly accepted his offer and started breaking down the tent again.

  At his home, I was immediately greeted Iranian style - a cup of tea and a lot of food. His mother had made a spinach-bean meal, which reminded me of the Dutch-style "stamppotje" spinach my mom would make at home. I had already finished dinner, but in a grandma-esque way they were really insistent on me eating a lot of it. Oh well, I was going to be cycling a lot the next day anyway!

  One thing that struck me about this family is how they spend the night - the whole family sleeps in the living room, even though they have more rooms in the house. Fortunately, they had mosquito nets!

  ## Riding into Tehran at night
  The next day, my goal was to get to Qom, which lies in the middle of Kashan and Tehran. I arrived there just before dark and looked for a cheap hotel or a place to put my tent, but all the simple hotels were full and there were no good spots to put up a tent. Oh, the pure joy of traveling without a plan!

  I had two options - keep looking for a place to put up the tent, or continue straight to Tehran. Although the latter might seem unreasonable because I had already pedaled 110km that day, I somehow still felt energetic, maybe because I was really looking forward to returning to the city that brought so many good memories on my last trip to Iran.

  So there I was, cycling next to the Iranian highway in the middle of the night. While to many that might sound like one of the dumbest tings a human being can do, I have learned that most Iranian drivers are very skilled because they are used to driving in chaos and people standing next to (main) roads. Plus, alcohol is illegal in the country so drunk drivers are practically nonexistant.

  In fact, by the time I got to Tehran, this turned out to be a *great* idea. I remembered from my last visit to Iran that Istanbul's traffic is calm compared to the pure madness in Iran's capital. However, at 3AM, the traffic was much lighter and the drivers seemed less pushy because their job didn't depend on it.
